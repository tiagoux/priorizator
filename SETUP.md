# Quick Setup Guide

## Current Status ✅

The application has been successfully set up with:

- ✅ All dependencies installed
- ✅ Configuration files fixed (PostCSS, Next.js config)
- ✅ Missing packages added (React Router, Supabase auth helpers)
- ✅ Environment variables template created
- ✅ Repository pushed to GitHub

## Next Steps to Complete Local Setup

### 1. Set up Supabase Project

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a new project
2. Once created, go to **Settings > API** 
3. Copy your **Project URL** and **anon/public key**

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

1. Update your `.env.local` file with real Supabase credentials:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-actual-project-id.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_actual_anon_key_here
   ```

### 3. Set up Database

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **SQL Editor**
2. Run the migration files located in `supabase/migrations/` in chronological order
3. Or use the Supabase CLI to apply migrations:
   ```bash
   npx supabase migration up
   ```

### 4. Test the Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app should now be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Architecture Notes

This application uses a **hybrid architecture**:
- **Next.js 14** with App Router for the main framework
- **React Router** for component-level routing (legacy from original setup)
- **Supabase** for backend services (auth, database)
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling

## Troubleshooting

- If you see "Missing Supabase environment variables" - check your `.env.local` file
- If React Router errors occur - the BrowserRouter provider is already set up in `app/providers.tsx`
- For database errors - ensure migrations are applied in your Supabase project

## Development Commands

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production  
- `npm run lint` - Run linting
- `npm run start` - Start production server
